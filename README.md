 Simple clock program written in ***C++*** with a simple graphic library (Borland Graphics Interface).
### Features
* integrated menu
* Digital CLock
* alarm
* posibility of changing the time zone
* posibility  of changing the time format (24 hour to 12 hour)

### What I've learned
* working with different libraries
* how to use pointers
* how to write clean code
* I need to keep things as simple as I can
* planning beforehand is more important than taking action right away
* how to manage a bigger amount of code
